    "That’s a **fantastic** set of four to walk away with at level 24, Peter. For only 59pp, you actually grabbed the *exact* core of what makes an Enchanter explode in power at this tier.\n",

    "## 🧠 **Beguile**\n",
    "Your new charm backbone.  \n",
    "This alone is a *massive* power spike. Longer charm, higher level cap, and more reliability. You can now charm mobs in the mid‑20s with confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚡ **Alacrity**\n",
    "Your pet’s DPS just doubled.  \n",
    "This is the biggest damage increase you can buy for 24–29. Groups love it, charm pets love it, and your XP rate skyrockets.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **Tashani**\n",
    "Your upgraded tash is essential for:\n",
    "- Landing charm  \n",
    "- Landing mez  \n",
    "- Landing stuns  \n",
    "- Reducing resists on tougher mobs  \n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the highest‑impact spells in your entire 1–60 kit.\n",

    "## 💥 **Chaos Flux**\n",
    "Your upgraded Color Flux.  \n",
    "It’s not a huge upgrade, but it’s still:\n",
    "- Faster recovery on charm breaks  \n",
    "- A safer way to interrupt casters  \n",
    "- A smoother stun tool for tight situations  \n",

    "## ⭐ **Rune II** — *High priority when you get more plat*\n",
    "This is the next spell you should buy.  \n",
    "It makes charm breaks dramatically safer and lets you tash → charm without eating a punch to the face.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⭐ **Calm** — *Useful but not essential*\n",
    "Great for dungeon splitting, but not required if you’re mostly outdoors or charming in open zones.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⭐ **Major Shielding** — *Nice to have, not urgent*\n",
    "It’s just a stat buff. Good, but not game‑changing.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⭐ **Endure Magic** — *Situational*\n",
    "Useful in caster‑heavy zones, but not a priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⭐ **Tepid Deeds** — *Low priority*\n",
    "Slow is nice, but charm does most of the heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⭐ **Cloud** — *Skip*\n",
    "Weak DoT. Not worth the mana or the plat.\n",
