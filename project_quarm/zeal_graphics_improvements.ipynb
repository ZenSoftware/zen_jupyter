    "# 🔧 Zeal Settings That Improve Sharpness\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **1. Increase Internal Rendering Resolution**\n",
    "Zeal lets you render the game at a higher internal resolution than your window, which produces a crisp, anti‑aliased look.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Go to:\n",
    "**Options → Zeal → Graphics**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adjust:\n",
    "- **Render Scale:**  \n",
    "  - Set to **1.25×** or **1.5×** for a noticeable clarity boost  \n",
    "  - Set to **2×** if your GPU can handle it (big jump in sharpness)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the single most impactful setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎨 **2. Enable Zeal’s Enhanced Texture Filtering**\n",
    "The original client uses very basic bilinear filtering. Zeal upgrades this.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Options → Zeal → Graphics\n",
    "- **Texture Filtering:** set to **Anisotropic 16×**\n",
    "- **Mipmap Bias:** set to **-1.0** (sharper textures at distance)\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes ground textures, walls, and armor patterns much clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🖼️ **3. Improve UI and Font Rendering**\n",
    "Zeal’s font engine is vastly better than the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Options → Zeal → Nameplate / Text\n",
    "- **Font:** choose a high‑quality `.spritefont` (you already know where to place them)\n",
    "- **Font Size:** increase by 1–2 points for crispness\n",
    "- **Outline Thickness:** set to **1**  \n",
    "- **Shadow:** set to **0** (shadows blur text)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Options → Zeal → UI\n",
    "- **UI Scaling:** set to **1.0** (avoid fractional scaling, which blurs UI textures)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌫️ **4. Disable Blur‑Inducing Legacy Effects**\n",
    "The 2002 client uses some “softening” effects that look muddy on modern monitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In `eqclient.ini`:\n",
    "```\n",
    "MipMapping=FALSE\n",
    "TextureQuality=1\n",
    "UseLitBatches=TRUE\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-game:\n",
    "- Turn **off** “Advanced Lighting”  \n",
    "- Turn **off** “Dynamic Lighting”  \n",
    "- Turn **off** “Sky Cubemap” (Luclin skybox is low-res)\n",
    "\n",
    "These reduce blur and shimmering.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🖥️ **5. Use dgVoodoo2 for Sharper Output**\n",
    "You already have dgVoodoo2 installed, so tune it for clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In dgVoodooCpl:\n",
    "- **Antialiasing:** 4× or 8×  \n",
    "- **Texture Filtering:** Force **Anisotropic 16×**  \n",
    "- **Resolution:** “Unforced” (let Zeal handle scaling)  \n",
    "- **VRAM:** Max it out  \n",
    "- **Disable watermark:** On  \n",
    "\n",
    "dgVoodoo2 + Zeal’s render scaling = the cleanest possible output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🧪 Recommended “Sharpness Preset”\n",
    "If you want a quick, reliable setup:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zeal:\n",
    "- Render Scale: **1.5×**\n",
    "- Texture Filtering: **Anisotropic 16×**\n",
    "- Mipmap Bias: **-1.0**\n",
    "- UI Scale: **1.0**\n",
    "- High‑quality spritefont selected\n",
    "\n",
    "### dgVoodoo2:\n",
    "- Antialiasing: **4×**\n",
    "- Texture Filtering: **16×**\n",
    "- VRAM: **Max**\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination gives a crisp, modern look while keeping the classic feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# If you want, I can help you:\n",
    "- Pick the best spritefont for your UI  \n",
    "- Tune settings for your specific GPU  \n",
    "- Compare screenshots and optimize further  \n",
    "- Build a “performance mode” vs “quality mode” profile  \n",
    "\n",
    "Just tell me what kind of look you’re aiming for — ultra crisp, classic but clean, or something in between."
