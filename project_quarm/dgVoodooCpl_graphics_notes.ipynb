    "Absolutely, Peter — and this is right in your wheelhouse. Since you’re already deep into Zeal, dgVoodoo2, and visual optimization, here’s a clean, practical walkthrough that gets you *exactly* those settings without any guesswork.\n",

    "## 🎨 dgVoodooCpl Setup for Project Quarm (Zeal Client)\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps assume you’re using **dgVoodoo2 v2.8+** and have the **dgVoodooCpl.exe** in the same folder as your EQ client (or pointed at it via the config path).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🖥️ 1. Open dgVoodooCpl\n",
    "- Run **dgVoodooCpl.exe**  \n",
    "- Make sure the **Config Folder / Running Instance** is pointed at your **Project Quarm / Zeal** directory so the settings apply to the right client.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ 2. Go to the **DirectX** tab  \n",
    "This is where all the important rendering overrides live.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Antialiasing**\n",
    "- Find **Antialiasing (MSAA)**  \n",
    "- Set it to **4×** or **8×**  \n",
    "  - 4× = great balance  \n",
    "  - 8× = slightly sharper edges, slightly heavier GPU load  \n",
    "- EQ is ancient, so even 8× barely dents modern hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Texture Filtering**\n",
    "- Find **Force anisotropic filtering**  \n",
    "- Set it to **16×**  \n",
    "  - This dramatically sharpens ground textures, walls, and long-distance surfaces  \n",
    "  - EQ benefits *massively* from this because the original mipmaps are low-res\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Resolution**\n",
    "- Find **Resolution** dropdown  \n",
    "- Set it to **Unforced**  \n",
    "  - This is important:  \n",
    "    - **Zeal handles scaling internally**, and forcing a resolution in dgVoodoo can cause UI stretching or blur  \n",
    "  - Unforced = cleanest results with Zeal’s renderer\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **VRAM**\n",
    "- Find **VRAM** slider  \n",
    "- Set it to the **maximum value**  \n",
    "  - dgVoodoo uses this as a virtual cap  \n",
    "  - Maxing it prevents texture thrashing and improves stability with high-res icon packs or UI mods\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **dgVoodoo Watermark**\n",
    "- Find **dgVoodoo watermark**  \n",
    "- Set it to **Off**  \n",
    "  - Removes the red watermark in the corner  \n",
    "  - Makes screenshots and gameplay cleaner\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💾 3. Apply & Save\n",
    "- Click **Apply**  \n",
    "- Then click **OK**  \n",
    "- dgVoodoo writes a **dgVoodoo.conf** file into your Zeal folder\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 4. Quick Verification\n",
    "When you launch Project Quarm:\n",
    "- Edges should look smoother (AA)  \n",
    "- Distant terrain should be crisp (AF 16×)  \n",
    "- No dgVoodoo watermark  \n",
    "- No scaling artifacts (Zeal handles it)  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can also help you:\n",
    "- Tune Zeal’s internal renderer  \n",
    "- Pair this with dgVoodoo’s mipmapping options  \n",
    "- Optimize gamma/brightness for classic EQ lighting  \n",
    "- Compare dgVoodoo vs. pure Zeal rendering paths  \n",
    "\n",
    "Just say the word — you’re already building a gorgeous setup."
