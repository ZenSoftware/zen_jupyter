The best and only genuinely Luclin‑themed camp that becomes viable *right around your level* is the very front of *Shadeweaver’s Thicket*, with a smoother transition into *Paludal Caverns* at level 10.**\n",

    "## ⭐ Shadeweaver’s Thicket (Levels 5–12)\n",
    "This is the *only* Luclin zone that supports characters below level 10 without power‑leveling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why it works at level 7\n",
    "- Mobs near the **Shar Vahl zone‑in** are level **3–7**, perfect for you.\n",
    "- As you level, you can push deeper toward the **Hollowshade Moor** side where mobs reach **8–12**.\n",
    "- Extremely fast respawn and dense mob layout.\n",
    "- Safe terrain, easy escape routes, and lots of animals/humanoids with low damage output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to kill\n",
    "- **Rockhoppers** (young → mature)\n",
    "- **Lesser shades**\n",
    "- **Pumas**\n",
    "- **Tribal mobs** (only when you hit 8+)\n",

    "| Camp | Level Range | Notes |\n",
    "|------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| **Shar Vahl ramp** | 5–8 | Very safe, low‑damage mobs, great for steady XP. |\n",
    "| **Rockhopper fields** | 7–10 | Higher mob density, slightly tougher mobs. |\n",
    "| **NW shade ruins** | 8–12 | Undead shades, good XP, low HP mobs. |\n",

    "### Why it’s amazing\n",
    "- Massive ZEM (one of the highest in the game).\n",
    "- Mobs have low HP for their level.\n",

    "3. **Level 10+:**  \n",
