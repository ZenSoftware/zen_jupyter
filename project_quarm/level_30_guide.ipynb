    "Absolutely — and nice job organizing those tabs into a “Leveling guides” group. I pulled in everything from your open pages, especially the **Per‑Level Hunting Guide** and the **Platinum Making Guide** (your tab with the big list of camps). Here’s a clean, Enchanter‑focused summary of **all viable level 30 options** based on what’s in those pages.\n",

    "# ⭐ **Level 30 Enchanter Leveling Options (Based on Your Open Guides)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🏰 **1. Highkeep Guards (25–35)**  \n",
    "**Source:** Platinum Making Guide   \n",
    "- One of the strongest XP + plat camps in classic EQ.  \n",
    "- Guards drop **Fine Steel Short Swords** (3.5–5p each) + 1–5p per kill.  \n",
    "- Floors 1–2 are lower level; **floors 3–4 are perfect for level 30**.  \n",
    "- There’s a **beta‑neutral vendor** (Tarn Visilin) you can sell to.  \n",
    "- You can bank by using sneak/harmony/FD or by tanking the banker briefly.  \n",
    "- **Charm is extremely strong here** — plenty of humanoid pets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Downside:** Heavy Freeport faction hits.\n",

    "## 🌲 **2. South Karana – Aviak Village (20–30+)**  \n",
    "**Source:** Platinum Making Guide (Aviak note)   \n",
    "- Egrets drop **1–5p each**, plus gems.  \n",
    "- You can vendor to **Krak Windchaser** at the top of the tree.  \n",
    "- Good charm pets (Aviak darters/warriors).  \n",
    "- Wide open, safe, and easy to control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Downside:** XP slows after 30, but still viable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧟 **3. Paineel Undead Guards (18–28+, but can push to low 30s)**  \n",
    "**Source:** Platinum Making Guide   \n",
    "- Undead guards drop **Bronze Bastard Swords** (~2.5p) and **Kite Shields** (~3.5p).  \n",
    "- **No faction hits at all** — extremely rare for guard camps.  \n",
    "- You can vendor and bank right inside Paineel if faction allows.  \n",
    "- Some guards con blue into the early 30s.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Downside:** Starts to thin out at 30; better as a money camp than pure XP now.\n",

    "## 🧝 **4. Highkeep Basement – Goblins (29–34)**  \n",
    "**Source:** Per‑Level Hunting Guide (your tab includes this range)   \n",

    "- Technically below your level, but still blue at 30 on some spawns.  \n",
    "- Gargoyle Eyes sell extremely well to players.  \n",
    "- Easy charm kills.\n",

    "**Downside:** XP is slowing at 30; better for money than leveling now.\n",

    "## 🐸 **6. Lake of Ill Omen – Sarnak Courier Circuit (20+)**  \n",
    "**Source:** Platinum Making Guide (Gazughi Ring camp)   \n",
    "- Not an XP hotspot, but if you want to **try for a Goblin Gazughi Ring**, this is the camp.  \n",
    "- Respawns are fast, charmable mobs everywhere.  \n",
    "- The ring is a game‑changer for Enchanters.\n",
