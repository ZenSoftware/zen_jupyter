    "**Even though $ \\frac{dy}{dt} $ is *defined* as a limit (an operation), it *behaves* like a fraction because of a deeper mathematical structure.**\n",

    "Leibniz chose the notation $dy/dt$ *on purpose* because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- it suggests a tiny change in $y$ divided by a tiny change in $t$\n",
    "- it obeys algebra-like rules\n",

    "This is the key:  \n",
