    "# 📏 What is a differential equation\n",
    "\n",
    "A differential equation is an equation that relates an **unknown function** to one or more of its **derivatives**. In other words, it describes how something changes rather than just what it is.\n",

    "A clean, grounded definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📘 What it is\n",
    "A differential equation is *“an equation that relates one or more unknown functions and their derivatives.”*  \n",
    "Derivatives represent **rates of change**, so differential equations express how a quantity evolves over time, space, or another variable.\n",

    "## 🧠 Why they matter\n",
    "Many natural and engineered systems are governed by relationships between a quantity and its rate of change. That’s why differential equations appear in:\n",

    "- biology (population growth)\n",

    "  Newton’s second law written as a differential equation.\n",
    "- $ \\frac{dN}{dt} = rN $  \n",
    "  Population growth model.\n",

    "## 🗂️ Types (at a glance)\n",
    "- **Ordinary differential equations (ODEs):** derivatives with respect to one variable.\n",
    "- **Partial differential equations (PDEs):** derivatives with respect to multiple variables.\n",
    "- **Linear vs. nonlinear:** depends on how the unknown function appears."
