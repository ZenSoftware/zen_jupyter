    "**Peter:**\n",
    "> Why doesn't propositional logic use XOR or NAND?\n",
    "\n",
    "Great question, Peter — and it gets right to the heart of how logic is designed. The short answer is:\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **Propositional logic *can* use XOR or NAND — they’re just not chosen as the *standard* primitive connectives.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s unpack why.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔷 1. **Propositional logic doesn’t *need* XOR or NAND**\n",
    "Classical propositional logic is built around a *minimal* set of connectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **AND** (∧)  \n",
    "- **OR** (∨)  \n",
    "- **NOT** (¬)  \n",
    "- **IMPLIES** (→)  \n",
    "\n",
    "From these, you can define *every other* Boolean connective, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- XOR  \n",
    "- NAND  \n",
    "- NOR  \n",
    "- XNOR  \n",
    "- etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So XOR and NAND aren’t excluded — they’re just *derivable*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p \\oplus q \\equiv (p \\lor q) \\land \\neg(p \\land q)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p \\uparrow q \\equiv \\neg(p \\land q)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since they’re definable, they don’t need to be primitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔷 2. **Logic prefers “truth‑functional completeness” with minimal primitives**\n",
    "A connective set is **functionally complete** if it can express *all* Boolean functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard set {¬, ∧, ∨} is functionally complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here’s the twist:\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **NAND alone is also functionally complete.**  \n",
    "👉 **NOR alone is also functionally complete.**\n",
    "\n",
    "So you *could* build all of propositional logic using only NAND.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, digital circuits *do* exactly that.\n",
    "\n",
    "But logicians prefer connectives that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- match natural language  \n",
    "- are easy to reason with  \n",
    "- have clean proof rules  \n",
    "- align with classical inference patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "NAND and XOR are less intuitive for humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔷 3. **XOR is not monotone or truth‑preserving**\n",
    "XOR behaves strangely from a proof‑theoretic perspective:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It’s not monotone  \n",
    "- It doesn’t preserve truth under substitution  \n",
    "- It doesn’t correspond to a natural inference rule  \n",
    "- It doesn’t appear in classical syllogisms or natural language\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, “either A or B but not both” is a very *specific* kind of disjunction, not a general one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So XOR is useful, but not foundational.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔷 4. **NAND is too “low‑level” for human reasoning**\n",
    "NAND is perfect for hardware, because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- it’s easy to implement physically  \n",
    "- it’s functionally complete  \n",
    "- it simplifies circuit design\n",
    "\n",
    "But for human reasoning, NAND is awkward:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It doesn’t correspond to any natural linguistic connective  \n",
    "- It doesn’t have simple introduction/elimination rules  \n",
    "- Proofs become unreadable\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine doing a proof where every statement is of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\neg(p \\land q)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s possible — but painful.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔷 5. **Proof systems are built around connectives with clean inference rules**\n",
    "Connectives like ∧, ∨, ¬, → have elegant rules in:\n",
    "\n",
    "- natural deduction  \n",
    "- sequent calculus  \n",
    "- Hilbert systems  \n",
    "- type theory (Curry–Howard)\n",
    "\n",
    "XOR and NAND do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the introduction rule for ∧ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{p \\quad q}{p \\land q}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no comparably simple rule for XOR.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🎯 **Bottom line**\n",
    "Propositional logic *could* use XOR or NAND as primitives — they’re fully expressive — but it doesn’t because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They’re less intuitive  \n",
    "- They don’t match natural reasoning  \n",
    "- Their proof rules are messy  \n",
    "- They’re easily definable from simpler connectives  \n",
    "- The standard connectives form a clean, minimal, human‑friendly basis\n",
    "\n",
    "In short:\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **XOR and NAND are powerful, but not pleasant.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can show you:\n",
    "\n",
    "- how to build all of propositional logic using only NAND  \n",
    "- how XOR behaves in proof systems  \n",
    "- how these connectives appear in type theory (since you’re watching a type theory video)  \n",
    "- or how this ties into functional completeness and circuit complexity\n",
