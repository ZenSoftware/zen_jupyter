    "# 🧠 **Conceptual Questions on Euler’s Number & Complex Exponentials**\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Definitions & Foundations**\n",
    "- What is the defining property of the exponential function that uniquely determines $e^x$ among all functions?\n",
    "- How do you define $e^x$ using a power series, and why does this definition extend naturally to complex numbers?\n",
    "- Why is $e$ the unique base for which the derivative of $a^x$ equals the function itself?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Algebraic Structure**\n",
    "- Show why any exponential $a^x$ can be rewritten in the form $e^{kx}$. What is $k$ in terms of $a$?\n",
    "- If $z = x + iy$, derive the expression for $e^z$ by splitting into real and imaginary parts.\n",
    "- Why does $\\exp(\\ln(r) + i\\theta)$ produce the polar form of a complex number?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Euler’s Formula & Geometry**\n",
    "- Starting from the power series of $e^x$, derive Euler’s identity $e^{i\\theta} = \\cos\\theta + i\\sin\\theta$.\n",
    "- What is the geometric meaning of multiplying a complex number by $e^{i\\theta}$?\n",
    "- Why does $e^{i\\pi} = -1$? Explain using both algebraic and geometric reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Magnitude & Argument**\n",
    "- For $z = e^{x+iy}$, what is $|z|$? What is $\\arg(z)$?\n",
    "- If $e^{i\\theta}$ lies on the unit circle, why does its magnitude always equal 1?\n",
    "- If $e^{z_1} = e^{z_2}$, what can you say about $z_1 - z_2$? (Hint: periodicity.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Complex Logarithms**\n",
    "- Why is the complex logarithm multi‑valued?  \n",
    "- Write the general form of $\\log(re^{i\\theta})$.\n",
    "- Why does $\\exp(\\log z)$ not always equal $z$ in the complex plane?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. Growth & Differential Equations**\n",
    "- Why is $e^x$ the natural solution to the differential equation $y' = y$?\n",
    "- If $y' = ky$, why is the solution $y = Ce^{kx}$ rather than $y = Ca^x$?\n",
    "- What is the continuous compounding limit that defines $e$?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. Challenge Questions**\n",
    "- Evaluate $e^{i(\\theta + 2\\pi n)}$. Why does this show the periodicity of the complex exponential?\n",
    "- Solve $e^z = -1$ for all complex $z$.\n",
    "- If $z = re^{i\\theta}$, compute $\\ln(z^n)$ and explain why it differs from $n\\ln(z)$ unless you choose a branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can also turn these into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a graded quiz  \n",
    "- a set of multiple‑choice questions  \n",
    "- a step‑by‑step practice worksheet  \n",
    "- or a challenge exam with solutions  \n",
