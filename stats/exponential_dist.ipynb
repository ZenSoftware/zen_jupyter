    "# Exponential Distribution\n",
    "The Exponential distribution is a continuous probability distribution that models **waiting times between independent events** that occur at a **constant average rate**.  It is the natural model for \"how long until the next event happens\" in a **Poisson process**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as the distribution of:\n",
    "- Time until the next bus arrives (if buses come randomly but on average every 10 minutes)\n",
    "- Time until a radioactive particle decays\n",
    "- Time between customer arrivals at a service desk\n",
    "- Time until a machine fails\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Idea\n",
    "If events happen **independently** and with a **constant rate** $\\lambda$, then the waiting time $X$ until the next event follow an exponential distribution.\n",
    "- Rate parameter: $\\lambda > 0$\n",
    "- Mean waiting time: $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$\n",
