    "# Poisson Distribution\n",
    "The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models the number of events that occur within a fixed interval of **time**, **space**, or **opportunity**, given that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Events occur **independently**\n",
    "- Events occur at a **constant average rate**\n",
    "- Two events cannot occur at exactly the same instant (in the idealized model)\n",
    "- The probability of an event in a subinterval is proportional to the length of the subinterval\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Key Paramater: $\\lambda$\n",
    "The distribution is goverened by a single parameter:\n",
    "- $\\lambda$: the **average rate** (mean number of events per interval)\n",
    "\n",
    "This parameter is both the **mean** and the **variance** of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probability Mass Function (PMF)\n",
    "The probability of observing exactly *k* events is:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X=k) = \\frac{\\lambda^k e^{-\\lambda}}{k!}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "*k* is a non-negative integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Intuition\n",
    "Think of the Poisson distribution as a model for **random**, **independent \"arrivals\"**:\n",
    "- Customers entering a store\n",
    "- Emails arriving in your inbox\n",
    "- Meteors seen per hour\n",
    "- Defects in a manufacturing batch\n",
    "- Website hits per minute\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "Some classic uses include:\n",
    "- Modeling rare events (e.g., accidents, system failures)\n",
    "- Queueing theory (arrival of customers or packets)\n",
    "- Biology (mutations along DNA strands)\n",
    "- Physics (radioactive decay counts)\n",
    "- Historical analysis:\n",
    "  - Prussian cavalry deaths from horse kicks\n",
    "  - Bomb strikes in WWII London\n",

    "## Poisson Process\n",
    "A Poisson process is a mathematical model for events occurring randomly and independently over time (or space) at a constant average rate, where the number of events in any interval follows a Poisson distribution, and the time between events is exponentially distributed, meaning events happen without a fixed schedule but at a predictable average pace (e.g., customer arrivals, calls to a call center). \n",
    "Random & Independent: Events happen randomly and the occurrence of one doesn't affect the next.\n",
    "- Constant Rate (λ): Events occur at a steady average rate (lambda, λ) over time.\n",
    "- Memoryless: The waiting time for the next event is independent of how long you've already waited.\n",
    "- Counts: The number of events in a fixed time follows a Poisson distribution (e.g., probability of 3 calls in an hour).\n",
    "- Waiting Times: The time between events follows an exponential distribution (e.g., probability of waiting 5 minutes for the next call). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why It Matters\n",
    "The Poisson distribution is foundational because it:\n",
    "- Provides a simple model for **count data**\n",
    "- Has deep connections to the **exponential distribution**\n",
    "- Approximates the **binomial distribution** when *n* is large and *p* is small\n",
    "- Appears naturally in many stochastic systems\n",
    "\n",
    "### Shape and Behavior\n",
    "- For **small** $\\lambda$, the distribution is **skewed right** and heavily concentrated near 0\n",
    "- As $\\lambda$ increases, the distribution becomes more **symmetric** and resembles a normal distribution\n"
