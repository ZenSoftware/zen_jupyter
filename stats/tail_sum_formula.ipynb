    "# 📘 Tail Sum Formula — Study Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "[🎞️ Steve Brunton: The Tail Sum Formula in Probability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQYkD_fct1A&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR3sNYvfgiKgcStwuPSts9V&index=43)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Core Idea\n",
    "For a **non‑negative discrete random variable** $X$ taking values $0,1,2,\\dots,n$, the **expected value** can be computed not only by the usual formula  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{k=0}^{n} k \\cdot P(X=k),\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "but also by summing the *tail probabilities*:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[X] = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} P(X \\ge k).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This identity is called the **Tail Sum Formula** (or **Tail Expectation Formula**).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧱 Assumptions\n",
    "- $X$ is **non‑negative** (no negative values).\n",
    "- $X$ is **discrete**.\n",
    "- Often $X$ has a finite upper bound (e.g., binomial with max $n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧩 Why It Works — Intuition\n",
    "The standard expectation formula expands as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "1P(X=1) + 2P(X=2) + 3P(X=3) + \\dots + nP(X=n).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each term $kP(X=k)$ can be visualized as **k copies** of $P(X=k)$.  \n",
    "Stacking these copies forms a **triangular array**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Row 1: $P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + \\dots + P_n$  \n",
    "- Row 2: $P_2 + P_3 + \\dots + P_n$  \n",
    "- Row 3: $P_3 + \\dots + P_n$  \n",
    "- …  \n",
    "- Row n: $P_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row corresponds to:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X \\ge k)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "because $P(X \\ge k) = P_k + P_{k+1} + \\dots + P_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Summing all rows gives the tail-sum expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📐 Geometric Interpretation\n",
    "The triangular arrangement of probabilities forms a **stack of horizontal slices**, where:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Slice $k$ counts how many outcomes are at least $k$.\n",
    "- Summing slices = total “mass” = expected value.\n",
    "\n",
    "This mirrors geometric sums seen in distributions like geometric or exponential.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔄 Relation to the CDF\n",
    "Since  \n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(X \\ge k) = 1 - F(k-1),\n",
    "$$  \n",
    "the formula can also be written using the cumulative distribution function (CDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⭐ Why It’s Useful\n",
    "- Often **easier to compute** than the standard expectation formula.\n",
    "- Helpful when tail probabilities have simple forms.\n",
    "- Appears in:\n",
    "  - analysis of algorithms  \n",
    "  - queueing theory  \n",
    "  - reliability theory  \n",
    "  - bounding expectations via tail bounds\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 Summary\n",
    "The Tail Sum Formula rewrites expectation in terms of **reverse cumulative probabilities**, giving a surprisingly elegant and often more convenient way to compute $\\mathbb{E}[X]$. It emerges naturally from expanding the usual expectation formula and reorganizing terms into a triangular structure."
