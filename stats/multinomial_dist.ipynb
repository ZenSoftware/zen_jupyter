    "# 🎲 The Multinomial Distribution — A Complete, Intuitive Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The **multinomial distribution** is the natural generalization of the **binomial distribution** when you have **more than two possible outcomes** in each trial. Instead of “success/failure,” you might have categories like *red/green/blue*, or *A/B/C/D*, or the faces of a die.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to standard references, the multinomial distribution models the probability of obtaining specific counts for each of $k$ categories across $n$ independent trials, where each trial results in exactly one category and each category has a fixed probability.\n",

    "## 🧠 When to Use It\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the multinomial distribution when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You repeat the **same experiment** $n$ times  \n",
    "- Each trial has **k mutually exclusive outcomes**  \n",
    "- The probability of each outcome is **fixed**  \n",
    "- Each trial is **independent**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rolling a $k$-sided die $n$ times  \n",
    "- Counting survey responses across multiple categories  \n",
    "- Tracking colors drawn from an urn *with replacement*  \n",

    "$$\n",
