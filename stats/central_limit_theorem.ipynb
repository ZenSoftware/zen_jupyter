    "\n",
    "The video presents an intuitive, structured walkthrough of **why the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is true**, focusing on the underlying mechanics rather than a purely formal proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Core Ideas Covered\n",
    "- **Goal of the CLT:** Show that the sum (or average) of many independent, identically distributed random variables tends toward a **normal distribution**, regardless of the original distribution (as long as variance is finite).\n",
    "- **Key Strategy:**  \n",
    "  The proof uses **moment generating functions (MGFs)** or **characteristic functions** to track how distributions behave when summed.\n",
    "- **MGF Factorization:**  \n",
    "  Because independent variables have MGFs that multiply, the MGF of the normalized sum can be expanded using Taylor series.\n",
    "- **Normalization:**  \n",
    "  By centering and scaling the sum appropriately, higher‑order terms vanish as $n \\to \\infty$, leaving the MGF of a standard normal distribution.\n",
    "- **Conclusion:**  \n",
    "  Since MGFs uniquely determine distributions, the limiting distribution must be **Gaussian**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Intuition Emphasized\n",
    "- Repeated addition “smooths out” irregularities in the original distribution.\n",
    "- The Gaussian emerges as the *universal attractor* for sums of independent noise sources.\n",
    "- The proof highlights how the second moment (variance) dominates the limiting behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 What You’d Take Away\n",
    "- A conceptual and semi‑rigorous proof of the CLT.\n",
    "- A deeper appreciation for why the normal distribution appears everywhere.\n",
    "- A sense of how MGFs provide a powerful lens for understanding convergence."
