    "Markov’s inequality gives an **upper bound** on the probability that a **non‑negative** random variable takes on a value at least as large as some threshold.\n",

    "For a non‑negative random variable $X$ and any $a > 0$:\n",

    "# 🧠 **Intuition**\n",
    "Think of $\\mathbb{E}[X]$ as the “budget” of the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the average value is small, then the probability of seeing a very large value must also be small—otherwise the average would be pulled upward.\n",
