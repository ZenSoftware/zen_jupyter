    "## ✨ Additive Property of the Moment Generating Function (MGF) — Clear, Useful Notes\n",

    "[ 🎞️ Steve Brunton: Additive Property of the Moment Generating Function](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rn655n2JtgI&list=PLMrJAkhIeNNR3sNYvfgiKgcStwuPSts9V&index=41)\n",

    "The moment generating function is one of those beautifully efficient tools in probability: it packages *all* the moments of a random variable into a single function. The **additive property** is one of its most powerful features, especially when dealing with sums of random variables.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 📌 Definition Reminder\n",
    "For a random variable $X$, the **moment generating function** (MGF) is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_X(t) = \\mathbb{E}\\left[e^{tX}\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "MGFs (when they exist) uniquely determine the distribution.\n",

    "## 🧩 Additive Property (Core Idea)\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X$ and $Y$ are **independent** random variables, then the MGF of their sum is the **product** of their MGFs:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{X+Y}(t) = M_X(t)\\, M_Y(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This generalizes to any finite sum of independent random variables:\n",

    "M_{X_1 + X_2 + \\cdots + X_n}(t)\n",
    "= \\prod_{i=1}^{n} M_{X_i}(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔍 Why This Works (Intuition)\n",
    "\n",
    "Start from the definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{X+Y}(t) = \\mathbb{E}[e^{t(X+Y)}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Use exponent rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "e^{t(X+Y)} = e^{tX} e^{tY}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $X$ and $Y$ are **independent**, then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[e^{tX} e^{tY}] = \\mathbb{E}[e^{tX}] \\cdot \\mathbb{E}[e^{tY}]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{X+Y}(t) = M_X(t) M_Y(t)\n",

    "## 🎯 Why This Property Is So Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Finding distributions of sums**\n",
    "Many classical results rely on this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sum of independent Poisson → Poisson  \n",
    "- Sum of independent Normals → Normal  \n",
    "- Sum of independent Gammas → Gamma (with same rate)\n",
    "\n",
    "MGFs make these proofs one-liners.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Central Limit Theorem (CLT) intuition**\n",
    "MGFs help show that normalized sums converge to the MGF of a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Moment extraction**\n",
    "Once you have the MGF of a sum, you can differentiate to get moments:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[X^k] = M_X^{(k)}(0)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "## 🧪 Example: Sum of Independent Poisson Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_1)$, $Y \\sim \\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "MGF of Poisson($\\lambda$):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M(t) = \\exp(\\lambda(e^t - 1))\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "M_{X+Y}(t)\n",
    "= e^{\\lambda_1(e^t - 1)} \\cdot e^{\\lambda_2(e^t - 1)}\n",
    "= e^{(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2)(e^t - 1)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the MGF of $\\text{Poisson}(\\lambda_1 + \\lambda_2)$.\n",

    "## 🧠 Key Takeaways\n",
