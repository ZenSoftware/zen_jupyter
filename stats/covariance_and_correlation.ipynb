    "- Covariance and correlation quantify **how two random variables vary together**.  \n",
    "- They are central to probability, statistics, machine learning, PCA, regression, and high‑dimensional data analysis.  \n",
    "- Correlation is essentially a **normalized covariance**.\n",
    "- Covariance can classify 3 types of relationships\n",
    "  - Positive trends, the variables tend to move in the **same direction**\n",
    "  - Negative trends, the variables tend to move in **opposite directions**\n",
    "  - No trend, because there is no relationship\n",
