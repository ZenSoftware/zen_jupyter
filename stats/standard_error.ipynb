    "**The standard error is a measure of how much a sample statistic (like a mean or proportion) would vary if you repeated the sampling many times.** It tells you how *precise* your estimate is: smaller SE → more precise estimate. This definition is consistent across the sources retrieved.\n",

    "## 📘 What “Standard Error” Really Means\n",
    "- It is the **standard deviation of a sampling distribution**—usually the sampling distribution of the mean.\n",
    "- It reflects **uncertainty**: how much your sample mean might differ from the true population mean.\n",
    "- It decreases as sample size increases (because larger samples give more stable estimates).\n",
