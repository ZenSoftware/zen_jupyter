    "## 🎯 What Expected Value Represents\n",
    "- The **expected value** $E[X]$ (also called the *expectation value* or *mean*) is the **center of mass** of a probability distribution.\n",
    "- Intuitively: If you repeatedly sample from a distribution, the **average** of those samples will tend toward the expected value.\n",
    "- It is **not always** the most likely value — that’s the **mode**.\n",
