    "# Choosing Between Binomial, Poisson and Normal Distributions\n",
    "| Distribution | When to Use It | Key Conditions |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Binomial | Counting successes out of a fixed number of trials | Fixed n, two outcomes (success/failure), constant p, independent trials |\n",
    "| Poisson | Counting rare events over time/space with no fixed number of trials | Events occur independently, at a constant average rate $\\lambda$, events are rare |\n",
    "| Normal | Modeling countinous, symmetric, bell-shaped data OR approximating Binomial/Poisson | Continous variable, roughly symmetric; OR large *n* for approximation |\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Each Distribution\n",
    "#### Binomial Distribution\n",
    "Use it when:\n",
    "- You have a **fixed number of trials** *n*\n",
    "- Each trial has **two outcomes** (success/failure)\n",
    "- Probability of success *p* is **constant**\n",
    "- Trials are **independent**\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Number of defective items in a batch of 100\n",
    "- Number of students who pass an exam out of 30\n",
    "- Number of heads in 10 coin flips\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Binomial describes \"binary data from a finite sample\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Poisson Distribution\n",
    "Use it when:\n",
    "- You are counting **events in a continous interval** (time, area, volume)\n",
    "- Events occur **independently**\n",
    "- Events occur at a **constant average rate** $\\lambda$\n",
    "- Events are **rare** relative to the size of the interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- Number of emails arriving in an hour\n",
    "- Number of accidents at an intersection per month\n",
    "- Number of decay events in radioactive material\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Poisson describes \"binary data from an infinite sample\" and counts events in a population or interval\n",
    "\n",
    "**Relationship to Binomial:** Poisson is a **limit of the Binomial** when:\n",
    "- *n* is large\n",
    "- *p* is small\n",
    "- $\\lambda=np$ is moderate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normal Distribution\n",
    "Use it when:\n",
    "- The variable is **continuous**\n",
    "- The distribution is **symmetric and bell-shaped**\n",
    "- You are modeling natural variation (height, test scores, measurement error)\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- IQ scores\n",
    "- Measurement noise\n",
    "- Human heights\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why:** Normal describes continuous data with a symmetric bell shape\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normal as an Approximation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Normal can approximate:\n",
    "- **Binomial** when $np > 5$ and $n(1-p) > 5$\n",
    "- **Poisson** when $\\lambda$ is large (typically $\\lambda>10$)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the Normal distribution is so widely used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Choose in Practice\n",
    "Here's a simple flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 1: Is the variable continuous?\n",
    "- Yes $\\rightarrow$ Normal\n",
    "- No $\\rightarrow$ Go to Step 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Are you counting successes out of a fixed number of trials?\n",
    "- Yes $\\rightarrow$ Binomial\n",
    "- No $\\rightarrow$ Go to Step 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 3: Are you counting events in time/space with no fixed number of trials?\n",
    "- Yes $\\rightarrow$ Poisson\n",
    "- No $\\rightarrow$ Re-axamine assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Few Subtle Points\n",
    "**Binomial vs Poisson**\n",
    "- Use **Binomial** when you know the number of trials.\n",
    "- Use **Poisson** when the number of opportunities is effectively unlimited or unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Poisson vs Normal**\n",
    "- Use **Poisson** for small counts (0,1,2,3...)\n",
    "- Use **Normal** when counts are large and symmetric\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normal vs Binomial**\n",
    "- Use **Normal** when the Binomial is too large to compute directly and conditions for approximation hold."
