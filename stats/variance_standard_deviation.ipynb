    "# 📘 Notes on Variance and Standard Deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **What They Measure**\n",
    "Both **variance** and **standard deviation** quantify **spread** — how far data points tend to be from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the spread is small → data is tightly clustered.\n",
    "- If the spread is large → data is more dispersed.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are foundational because almost every statistical method (confidence intervals, regression, hypothesis tests, probability distributions) depends on understanding variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🔢 **Variance**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Definition\n",
    "Variance measures the **average squared deviation** from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a population:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \\mu)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sample:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s^2 = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \\bar{x})^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why square the deviations?\n",
    "- Squaring prevents positive and negative deviations from canceling out.\n",
    "- It penalizes large deviations more heavily.\n",
    "- It gives variance nice mathematical properties (especially in probability theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why divide by $n-1$ for samples?\n",
    "This is **Bessel’s correction**.  \n",
    "It corrects the bias that arises because the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is itself estimated from the data.  \n",
    "Using $n-1$ makes $s^2$ an **unbiased estimator** of the population variance.\n",

    "# 📏 **Standard Deviation**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Definition\n",
    "Standard deviation is the **square root of variance**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Population:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma = \\sqrt{\\sigma^2}\n",

    "Sample:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "s = \\sqrt{s^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why take the square root?\n",
    "- Variance is in **squared units** (e.g., meters², dollars²).\n",
    "- Standard deviation returns to the **original units**, making it more interpretable.\n",

    "\n",
    "# 🧠 **Intuition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine data points as people standing around a flagpole (the mean):\n",
    "\n",
    "- If everyone stands close → low variance, low standard deviation.\n",
    "- If people spread out → high variance, high standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance = average squared distance from the pole  \n",
    "Standard deviation = average distance from the pole (in original units)\n",

    "# 📊 **Properties**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ Always non-negative  \n",
    "Variance and SD are never negative because squared deviations are never negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ Sensitive to outliers  \n",
    "A single extreme value can dramatically increase variance and SD.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✔ Additivity for independent variables  \n",
    "If $X$ and $Y$ are independent:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Var}(X+Y) = \\text{Var}(X) + \\text{Var}(Y)\n",
    "$$\n",
