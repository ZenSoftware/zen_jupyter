    "\n",
    "## 🎯 **What They Measure**\n",
    "Both **variance** and **standard deviation** quantify **spread** — how far data points tend to be from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the spread is small → data is tightly clustered.\n",
    "- If the spread is large → data is more dispersed.\n",
    "\n",
    "They are foundational because almost every statistical method (confidence intervals, regression, hypothesis tests, probability distributions) depends on understanding variability.\n",

    "# 🔢 **Variance**\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✨ Definition\n",
    "Variance measures the **average squared deviation** from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a population:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma^2 = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}(x_i - \\mu)^2\n",

    "\n",
    "### Why square the deviations?\n",
    "- Squaring prevents positive and negative deviations from canceling out.\n",
    "- It penalizes large deviations more heavily.\n",
    "- It gives variance nice mathematical properties (especially in probability theory).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why divide by $n-1$ for samples?\n",
    "This is **Bessel’s correction**.  \n",
    "It corrects the bias that arises because the sample mean $\\bar{x}$ is itself estimated from the data.  \n",
    "Using $n-1$ makes $s^2$ an **unbiased estimator** of the population variance.\n",
